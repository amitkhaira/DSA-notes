Let's dive into the **Greedy Method**.

The Greedy Method is one of the most straightforward algorithm design strategies. It's intuitive, often easy to implement, and can be surprisingly powerful when applied to the right problems.

---

## Greedy Method: Key Notes

### 1. What is the Greedy Method?
The Greedy Method builds a solution piece by piece, always choosing the option that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit at the current step. It makes a **locally optimal choice** in the hope that this choice will lead to a **globally optimal solution**.

Think of it like this: you're at a crossroads, and you pick the path that *looks* best right now, without worrying too much about where it might lead you far down the line.

### 2. Core Idea
*   **Make a choice:** At each step, select the best available option according to some predefined criterion.
*   **Irreversible:** Once a choice is made, it's never reconsidered (no backtracking).
*   **Feasible:** The choice must satisfy the problem's constraints.
*   **Locally Optimal:** The choice is the best one available at that moment.
*   **Hope for Global Optimality:** The sequence of locally optimal choices ideally leads to a global optimum.

### 3. General Algorithm Structure
```
GreedyAlgorithm(Input I):
  Solution S = {} // Initialize an empty solution
  While I is not empty AND solution S is not complete:
    x = Select(I)  // Choose the best element from I based on a greedy criterion
    If S U {x} is feasible:
      S = S U {x}
    I = I \ {x}   // Remove x from consideration (or mark as considered)
  Return S
```

### 4. When Does Greedy Work? (Key Properties)
For a greedy algorithm to yield a globally optimal solution, the problem must typically exhibit two properties:

*   **a. Greedy Choice Property:**
    A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal (greedy) choice. In other words, we can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblem that remains. The choice made may depend on previous choices but not on future choices.

*   **b. Optimal Substructure:**
    An optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems. If we make a greedy choice, we are left with a smaller subproblem. The optimal substructure property means that if our initial choice is part of an optimal solution, then an optimal solution to the subproblem, combined with our greedy choice, will yield an optimal solution to the original problem.

    *(Note: Optimal substructure is also a property of dynamic programming problems. The difference is that in dynamic programming, we might explore multiple choices for a subproblem, whereas greedy commits to one.)*

### 5. When Might Greedy Fail?
Greedy algorithms don't always work. They fail when a locally optimal choice prevents you from reaching the true global optimum.
*   **Example:** The 0/1 Knapsack Problem (you either take an item or leave it). A greedy approach of picking the most valuable item first, or the item with the best value/weight ratio first, might not yield the optimal solution if that item fills up the knapsack too much, preventing other, collectively more valuable items from being chosen.
*   **Example:** Making change with arbitrary coin denominations (e.g., coins {1, 7, 10} and you need to make 14. Greedy: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 (5 coins). Optimal: 7 + 7 = 14 (2 coins)).

### 6. Proof Techniques for Greedy Algorithms
Proving a greedy algorithm is correct can sometimes be tricky. Common techniques include:
*   **Greedy Stays Ahead:** Show that after each step of the greedy algorithm, its partial solution is at least as good as (or "ahead of") any other algorithm's partial solution.
*   **Exchange Argument (Proof by Contradiction):**
    1.  Assume there's an optimal solution `OPT` that is *different* from the greedy solution `G`.
    2.  Find the first step where `G` makes a different choice than `OPT`.
    3.  Show that you can "exchange" the choice made by `OPT` with the choice made by `G` at that step, resulting in a new solution `OPT'` that is at least as good as `OPT` and is "closer" to `G`.
    4.  Repeat this process until `OPT'` becomes identical to `G`, proving `G` is also optimal.

### 7. Advantages of Greedy Algorithms
*   **Simplicity:** Often easier to design and implement than other techniques like Dynamic Programming or Backtracking.
*   **Efficiency:** Typically faster, often running in polynomial time (e.g., `O(N log N)` due to sorting, followed by `O(N)` for iteration).

### 8. Disadvantages of Greedy Algorithms
*   **Not Always Optimal:** The biggest drawback. They don't work for all optimization problems.
*   **Proof of Correctness:** Can be difficult. It's easy to come up with a greedy idea, but hard to prove it's correct.
*   **Short-sighted:** By focusing on local optima, they can miss the global optimum.

## Classic Greedy Problems & Code Examples (JavaScript)

Let's look at some classic problems where the greedy approach shines.

You got it! Let's break down Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack, and Huffman Coding with the same level of detail.

---

## 1. Activity Selection Problem

**Problem Statement:**
You are given `n` activities, each with a start time `s_i` and a finish time `f_i`. You need to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed by a single person (or on a single resource). An activity `i` can be performed if its start time `s_i` is after or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity.

**Greedy Choice:**
Sort the activities by their **finish times** in non-decreasing (ascending) order. Then, iterate through the sorted activities:
1.  Always select the first activity in the sorted list.
2.  For subsequent activities, select the next activity if its start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the *previously selected* activity.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a list of selected activities, `selectedActivities`.
    *   If the input list of activities is empty, return the empty `selectedActivities` list.

2.  **Sort:** Sort the input `activities` array based on their `finish` times in ascending order. If two activities have the same finish time, their relative order doesn't critically affect the outcome of *this specific* greedy strategy, though sorting by start time as a secondary criterion can be done for consistency.

3.  **Select First Activity:** Add the first activity from the sorted list to `selectedActivities`. Let `lastFinishTime` be the finish time of this first selected activity.

4.  **Iterate and Select:**
    Iterate through the rest of the sorted activities (from the second activity onwards). For each current activity:
    *   If its `start` time is greater than or equal to `lastFinishTime`:
        *   Add this current activity to `selectedActivities`.
        *   Update `lastFinishTime` to the `finish` time of this current activity.

5.  **Result:** `selectedActivities` contains a maximum set of non-overlapping activities.

**Why it's Greedy / Why it Works:**
The algorithm is greedy because at each step, it chooses an activity that finishes as early as possible. This choice is locally optimal because it leaves the maximum amount of time available for subsequent activities.

*   **Greedy Choice Property:** Consider the first activity `a_1` in the sorted list (earliest finish time). If there is an optimal solution `OPT` that does *not* include `a_1`, let `a_j` be the first activity in `OPT` (when `OPT` is sorted by finish times). Since `a_1` finishes no later than `a_j` (because `a_1` has the earliest finish time overall), we can replace `a_j` with `a_1` in `OPT` and still have a valid (non-overlapping) schedule. This new schedule is also optimal and includes `a_1`. This shows that there's always an optimal solution that includes the activity with the earliest finish time.
*   **Optimal Substructure:** After choosing `a_1`, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of activities that can be scheduled in the time remaining *after* `a_1` finishes. If the solution to this subproblem is optimal, then combining it with `a_1` gives an optimal solution to the original problem.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   Array (or List): To store activities (often as objects or tuples with `start` and `finish` properties).
*   Sorting mechanism.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Sorting the activities by finish times: `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of activities.
*   Iterating through the sorted activities: `O(N)`.
*   Overall: Dominated by sorting, so `O(N log N)`.

**JavaScript Code Example:**
(This is the same code as before, presented in the detailed format)
```javascript
function activitySelection(activities) {
    if (!activities || activities.length === 0) {
        return [];
    }

    // 1. Sort activities by their finish times
    activities.sort((a, b) => a.finish - b.finish);

    let selectedActivities = [];
    
    // 2. Always select the first activity (it finishes earliest)
    selectedActivities.push(activities[0]);
    let lastFinishTime = activities[0].finish;

    // 3. Iterate through the rest of the activities
    for (let i = 1; i < activities.length; i++) {
        // If this activity starts after or at the same time the previous one finished
        if (activities[i].start >= lastFinishTime) {
            selectedActivities.push(activities[i]);
            lastFinishTime = activities[i].finish;
        }
    }
    return selectedActivities;
}

// Example Usage:
const activitiesInput = [
    { name: "A1", start: 1, finish: 4 },  // Selected
    { name: "A2", start: 3, finish: 5 },
    { name: "A3", start: 0, finish: 6 },
    { name: "A4", start: 5, finish: 7 },  // Selected
    { name: "A5", start: 3, finish: 9 },
    { name: "A6", start: 5, finish: 9 },
    { name: "A7", start: 6, finish: 10 },
    { name: "A8", start: 8, finish: 11 }, // Selected
    { name: "A9", start: 8, finish: 12 },
    { name: "A10", start: 2, finish: 14 },
    { name: "A11", start: 12, finish: 16 } // Selected
];

console.log("Activity Selection Problem:");
const resultActivities = activitySelection([...activitiesInput]); // Use a copy to preserve original
console.log("Selected Activities:");
resultActivities.forEach(act => console.log(`${act.name}: Start = ${act.start}, Finish = ${act.finish}`));
// Expected Output:
// A1: Start = 1, Finish = 4
// A4: Start = 5, Finish = 7
// A8: Start = 8, Finish = 11
// A11: Start = 12, Finish = 16
```

## 2. Fractional Knapsack Problem

**Problem Statement:**
You have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity `W`. You are given `n` items, each with a value `v_i` and a weight `w_i`. You want to maximize the total value of items in the knapsack. You are allowed to take **fractions** of items (e.g., you can take 0.5 of an item, getting 0.5 of its value and 0.5 of its weight).

**Greedy Choice:**
Calculate the value-to-weight ratio (`value / weight`) for each item. At each step, pick the available item (or fraction of an item) that has the **highest value-to-weight ratio**.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `totalValue = 0`
    *   `currentWeight = 0`
    *   `chosenItemsDetails = []` (to store what fraction of which item is taken)

2.  **Calculate Ratios:** For each item, calculate its value-to-weight ratio: `item.ratio = item.value / item.weight`.

3.  **Sort Items:** Sort the items in descending order based on their calculated `ratio`.

4.  **Iterate and Fill Knapsack:**
    Iterate through the sorted items:
    a.  For the current item:
        *   If `currentWeight + item.weight <= W` (the whole item fits):
            *   Take the entire item.
            *   `totalValue += item.value`
            *   `currentWeight += item.weight`
            *   Record that 100% of this item was taken.
        *   Else (the whole item does not fit):
            *   Calculate the `remainingCapacity = W - currentWeight`.
            *   Take a fraction of the item: `fraction = remainingCapacity / item.weight`.
            *   `totalValue += item.value * fraction`
            *   `currentWeight += item.weight * fraction` (which should now be equal to `W`)
            *   Record that this `fraction` of the item was taken.
            *   The knapsack is now full, so break the loop.

5.  **Result:** `totalValue` holds the maximum possible value. `chosenItemsDetails` describes the items/fractions taken.

**Why it's Greedy / Why it Works:**
The algorithm is greedy because it always chooses the item that offers the most "bang for the buck" (highest value per unit of weight) at each step.

*   **Greedy Choice Property & Optimal Substructure (Exchange Argument Intuition):**
    Suppose there is an optimal solution `OPT` that doesn't follow this greedy strategy. This means at some point, `OPT` chose an item `j` (or a fraction of it) when an item `i` with a higher value-to-weight ratio was still available (or a fraction of `i` was available).
    We can improve `OPT` (or at least not make it worse):
    1.  Remove a small amount of item `j` (say, `x` weight units) from the knapsack.
    2.  Add an equivalent weight `x` of item `i` to the knapsack.
    Since item `i` has a higher value/weight ratio, adding `x` weight of `i` will contribute more value than removing `x` weight of `j` took away. Thus, the new solution is better or equal, and it's "closer" to the greedy solution. Repeating this exchange argument shows that the greedy strategy must be optimal. The ability to take fractions is crucial here.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   Array (or List): To store items (objects with `value`, `weight`, and calculated `ratio`).
*   Sorting mechanism.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Calculating ratios: `O(N)`.
*   Sorting items by ratio: `O(N log N)`.
*   Iterating through sorted items: `O(N)`.
*   Overall: Dominated by sorting, so `O(N log N)`.

**JavaScript Code Example:**
(This is the same code as before, presented in the detailed format)
```javascript
function fractionalKnapsack(capacity, items) {
    if (capacity <= 0 || !items || items.length === 0) {
        return { totalValue: 0, chosenItems: [] };
    }

    // 1. Calculate value-to-weight ratio for each item
    items.forEach(item => {
        item.ratio = item.value / item.weight; // Ensure weight is not 0 if it can happen
    });

    // 2. Sort items by ratio in descending order
    items.sort((a, b) => b.ratio - a.ratio);

    let currentWeight = 0;
    let totalValue = 0;
    let chosenItems = []; // To store details of what was taken

    // 3. Iterate through sorted items
    for (const item of items) {
        if (capacity - currentWeight === 0) break; // Knapsack is full

        if (item.weight <= capacity - currentWeight) {
            // Take the whole item
            currentWeight += item.weight;
            totalValue += item.value;
            chosenItems.push({ name: item.name, weightTaken: item.weight, valueGained: item.value, fraction: 1 });
        } else {
            // Take a fraction of the item
            const remainingCapacity = capacity - currentWeight;
            const fraction = remainingCapacity / item.weight;
            
            totalValue += item.value * fraction;
            currentWeight += item.weight * fraction; 
            chosenItems.push({ 
                name: item.name, 
                weightTaken: item.weight * fraction, 
                valueGained: item.value * fraction, 
                fraction: fraction 
            });
            break; // Knapsack is full
        }
    }
    return { totalValue, chosenItems };
}

// Example Usage:
const knapsackItems = [
    { name: "ItemA", value: 60, weight: 10 },  // Ratio: 6
    { name: "ItemB", value: 100, weight: 20 }, // Ratio: 5
    { name: "ItemC", value: 120, weight: 30 }  // Ratio: 4
];
const knapsackCapacityW = 50;

console.log("\nFractional Knapsack Problem:");
const resultKnapsack = fractionalKnapsack(knapsackCapacityW, [...knapsackItems].map(i => ({...i}))); // Deep copy for safety
console.log(`Knapsack Capacity: ${knapsackCapacityW}`);
console.log(`Total Value: ${resultKnapsack.totalValue.toFixed(2)}`);
resultKnapsack.chosenItems.forEach(item => {
    console.log(
        `  ${item.name}: Weight taken = ${item.weightTaken.toFixed(2)}, Value gained = ${item.valueGained.toFixed(2)}, Fraction = ${item.fraction.toFixed(2)}`
    );
});
// Expected Output:
// Total Value: 240.00
// ItemA: Weight taken = 10.00, Value gained = 60.00, Fraction = 1.00
// ItemB: Weight taken = 20.00, Value gained = 100.00, Fraction = 1.00
// ItemC: Weight taken = 20.00, Value gained = 80.00, Fraction = 0.67
```

## 3. Huffman Coding

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of characters and their frequencies (how often each character appears in a given text), the goal is to find a **prefix code** (no codeword is a prefix of another codeword) for these characters such that the total length of the encoded message (sum of `frequency[char] * length[codeword[char]]`) is minimized. This is a fundamental algorithm for lossless data compression.

**Greedy Choice:**
At each step of building the Huffman tree, select the two nodes (either individual characters or already formed subtrees) that have the **lowest frequencies**. Merge these two nodes into a new internal node whose frequency is the sum of the frequencies of its two children.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   For each unique character, create a leaf node containing the character and its frequency.
    *   Create a min-priority queue and insert all these leaf nodes into it. The priority queue should order nodes by their frequencies (lowest frequency has highest priority).

2.  **Build Huffman Tree:**
    While there is more than one node in the priority queue:
    a.  Extract the two nodes with the minimum frequencies from the priority queue. Let these be `node1` (e.g., left child) and `node2` (e.g., right child).
    b.  Create a new internal node.
        *   Its frequency is `node1.frequency + node2.frequency`.
        *   `node1` becomes its left child.
        *   `node2` becomes its right child.
        (The character for this internal node can be null or a special symbol; it's not used for encoding data directly).
    c.  Insert this new internal node back into the priority queue.

3.  **Tree Completion:** When only one node remains in the priority queue, this node is the root of the Huffman tree.

4.  **Assign Codes:** Traverse the Huffman tree from the root to assign binary codes to each character (leaf node):
    *   Assign '0' to edges leading to a left child.
    *   Assign '1' to edges leading to a right child.
    *   The code for a character is the sequence of 0s and 1s on the path from the root to the character's leaf node.

5.  **Result:** A map of characters to their optimal prefix binary codes.

**Why it's Greedy / Why it Works:**
The algorithm is greedy because it always merges the two least frequent nodes. This strategy ensures that characters with low frequencies are placed further down in the tree (resulting in longer codewords), while characters with high frequencies are placed closer to the root (resulting in shorter codewords).

*   **Intuition:** To minimize the weighted sum `Σ (frequency * code_length)`, we want frequently occurring characters to have short codes and infrequently occurring characters to have long codes.
*   **Optimal Prefix Code Property:** It can be proven that an optimal prefix code for a given set of characters and frequencies can always be represented by a full binary tree where every leaf node corresponds to a character, and the two least frequent characters are siblings (share the same parent) at the deepest level of the tree.
*   **Greedy Choice Property:** The act of merging the two current least frequent nodes `x` and `y` and treating them as a single new node `z` with frequency `freq(x) + freq(y)` effectively reduces the problem. If there's an optimal tree for the reduced alphabet (with `z`), we can replace `z` with an internal node having `x` and `y` as children to get an optimal tree for the original alphabet. This is because `x` and `y` will have codewords that are one bit longer than `z`'s "codeword" in the reduced problem, and since they are the least frequent, this incremental length is applied to the smallest frequencies.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   Min-Priority Queue (Min-Heap): To store nodes and efficiently extract the two with minimum frequencies.
*   Tree Nodes: To build the Huffman tree. Each node typically stores:
    *   Character (for leaf nodes)
    *   Frequency
    *   Left child pointer
    *   Right child pointer
*   Map (or Dictionary): To store the final character-to-codeword mappings.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Let `C` be the number of unique characters.
*   Building the initial priority queue: `O(C)` if using heapify, or `O(C log C)` if inserting one by one.
*   The loop runs `C-1` times (to perform `C-1` merges).
    *   Each iteration involves two `extractMin` operations (`O(log C)`) and one `insert` operation (`O(log C)`) on the priority queue.
*   Total for tree construction: `O(C log C)`.
*   Traversing the tree to assign codes: `O(C * L_max)` in the worst case where `L_max` is the maximum code length, or simply `O(C)` if considering the sum of path lengths in a binary tree (proportional to number of nodes). Typically stated as `O(C log C)` dominated by tree construction.

**JavaScript Code Example:**
(Using the `MinHeap` from the Optimal Merge Pattern example for simplicity with modifications for node objects)

```javascript
// Node structure for Huffman Tree
class HuffmanNode {
    constructor(char, freq, left = null, right = null) {
        this.char = char;     // Character (null for internal nodes)
        this.freq = freq;     // Frequency
        this.left = left;     // Left child
        this.right = right;   // Right child
    }
}

// MinHeap adapted to work with HuffmanNode objects based on frequency
class HuffmanMinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = []; // Stores HuffmanNode objects
    }

    insert(node) {
        this.heap.push(node);
        this._heapifyUp();
    }

    extractMin() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return null;
        if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();

        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this._heapifyDown();
        return min;
    }

    }

                [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]] = [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]];
                index = parentIndex;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    _heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.heap.length;
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let smallest = index;

            if (leftChildIndex < length && this.heap[leftChildIndex].freq < this.heap[smallest].freq) {
                smallest = leftChildIndex;
            }
            if (rightChildIndex < length && this.heap[rightChildIndex].freq < this.heap[smallest].freq) {
                smallest = rightChildIndex;
            }

            if (smallest !== index) {
                [this.heap[index], this.heap[smallest]] = [this.heap[smallest], this.heap[index]];
                index = smallest;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

## 4. Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a weighted graph (where edge weights are non-negative) and a source vertex `s`, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from `s` to every other vertex in the graph.

**Greedy Choice:**
At each step, select the unvisited vertex `u` that has the smallest known tentative distance from the source `s`. Once a vertex is selected, its shortest distance from the source is considered finalized.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a distance array `dist`, where `dist[v]` stores the current shortest distance estimate from `s` to `v`. Initialize `dist[s] = 0` and `dist[v] = Infinity` for all other vertices `v`.
    *   Create a predecessor array `prev`, where `prev[v]` stores the vertex from which `v` is reached on the shortest path from `s`. Initialize all `prev[v]` to `null`.
    *   Create a set or boolean array `visited` to keep track of vertices for which the shortest path has been finalized. Initialize all to `false`.
    *   Often, a min-priority queue is used to efficiently extract the vertex with the minimum distance. For simplicity here, we might simulate it or use an array search.

2.  **Iteration:**
    While there are unvisited vertices:
    a.  Select an unvisited vertex `u` that has the minimum `dist[u]`. (This is the greedy choice).
    b.  Mark `u` as visited.
    c.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:
        *   If `v` is not visited AND the path through `u` to `v` is shorter than the current `dist[v]` (i.e., `dist[u] + weight(u, v) < dist[v]`):
            *   Update `dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)`.
            *   Set `prev[v] = u`.
            *   If using a priority queue, update `v`'s priority.

3.  **Result:** The `dist` array contains the shortest path lengths, and the `prev` array can be used to reconstruct the paths.

**Why it's Greedy:**
Dijkstra's algorithm makes a locally optimal choice at each step: it picks the "closest" unvisited vertex. It assumes that by always extending the path from the globally closest unvisited vertex, it will eventually find the shortest paths to all other vertices. This works because edge weights are non-negative. If there were negative edges, a path that initially looks longer could become shorter later via a negative edge, invalidating the greedy choice.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   Adjacency List: To represent the graph.
*   Min-Priority Queue: To efficiently find the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance.
*   Arrays/Maps: To store distances, predecessors, and visited status.

**Time Complexity:**
*   With an adjacency list and a min-priority queue (e.g., binary heap): `O((V + E) log V)` or `O(E log V)` if `E > V`.
*   With an adjacency matrix or adjacency list and searching for min distance in an array: `O(V^2)`.
    (`V` = number of vertices, `E` = number of edges)

**JavaScript Code Example:**

```javascript
class PriorityQueue { // Simple Min-Priority Queue for Dijkstra
    constructor() {
        this.elements = []; // { vertex: 'A', priority: 0 }
    }

    enqueue(element, priority) {
        this.elements.push({ element, priority });
        this.elements.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority); // Keep sorted
    }

    dequeue() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return null;
        return this.elements.shift().element;
    }

    updatePriority(element, newPriority) {
        let found = false;
        for (let i = 0; i < this.elements.length; i++) {
            if (this.elements[i].element === element) {
                this.elements[i].priority = newPriority;
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (found) {
            this.elements.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
        } else {
            this.enqueue(element, newPriority); // If not found, enqueue it
        }
    }
    
    isEmpty() {
        return this.elements.length === 0;
    }
}

function dijkstra(graph, startNode) {
    const distances = {};        // Stores shortest distance from startNode to each node
    const predecessors = {};     // Stores predecessor of each node in the shortest path
    const pq = new PriorityQueue(); // Priority queue of nodes to visit
    const visited = new Set();      // Set of visited nodes

    // Initialize distances: Infinity for all, 0 for startNode
    for (const vertex in graph) {
        distances[vertex] = Infinity;
        predecessors[vertex] = null;
    }
    distances[startNode] = 0;

    // Add startNode to priority queue
    pq.enqueue(startNode, 0);

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        const currentNode = pq.dequeue();

        if (visited.has(currentNode)) {
            continue; // Already processed this node with its shortest path
        }
        visited.add(currentNode);

        // If graph[currentNode] is undefined, it means currentNode has no outgoing edges
        if (!graph[currentNode]) continue; 

        for (const neighbor in graph[currentNode]) {
            if (visited.has(neighbor)) continue;

            const weight = graph[currentNode][neighbor];
            const distanceThroughCurrentNode = distances[currentNode] + weight;

            if (distanceThroughCurrentNode < distances[neighbor]) {
                distances[neighbor] = distanceThroughCurrentNode;
                predecessors[neighbor] = currentNode;
                // For a more efficient PQ, this would be a decrease-key operation
                pq.updatePriority(neighbor, distances[neighbor]); 
            }
        }
    }
    return { distances, predecessors };
}

// Example Graph (Adjacency List: node -> {neighbor: weight})

    'D': { 'B': 10, 'C': 3, 'E': 4 },
    'E': { 'C': 8, 'D': 4 } // Added 'C' neighbor for E

## 5. Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, Prim's algorithm finds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). An MST is a subgraph that connects all vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

**Greedy Choice:**
At each step, grow the MST by adding the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex currently in the MST to a vertex not yet in the MST.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty set `mstEdges` to store the edges of the MST.
    *   Create a boolean array `inMST` (or a `Set`) to track vertices already included in the MST.
    *   Create an array `key` where `key[v]` stores the minimum weight of an edge connecting vertex `v` to the MST. Initialize `key[startVertex] = 0` and `key[v] = Infinity` for all other `v`.
    *   Create an array `parent` where `parent[v]` stores the vertex in the MST that `v` connects to via its minimum-weight edge. Initialize `parent[startVertex] = null`.
    *   Use a min-priority queue to store vertices not yet in the MST, prioritized by their `key` values. Add all vertices to the PQ.

2.  **Iteration:**
    While the priority queue is not empty (or until `V-1` edges are in `mstEdges`):
    a.  Extract the vertex `u` from the PQ with the minimum `key` value. (This is the greedy choice for the vertex to add).
    b.  Add `u` to `inMST`.
    c.  If `parent[u]` is not `null`, add the edge `(parent[u], u)` with weight `key[u]` to `mstEdges`.
    d.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:
        *   If `v` is not in `inMST` AND `weight(u, v) < key[v]`:
            *   Update `key[v] = weight(u, v)`.
            *   Set `parent[v] = u`.
            *   Update `v`'s priority in the PQ with the new `key[v]`.

3.  **Result:** `mstEdges` contains the edges of an MST. The total weight is the sum of weights of these edges.

**Why it's Greedy:**
Prim's algorithm is greedy because it always chooses the "cheapest" edge to connect a new vertex to the growing tree. It builds the MST one vertex/edge at a time, always making the locally optimal choice of the next edge to add. The correctness is often proven using the "cut property" of MSTs.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   Adjacency List: For graph representation.
*   Min-Priority Queue: For vertices not yet in the MST, prioritized by `key` values.
*   Arrays: For `key`, `parent`, and `inMST`.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Similar to Dijkstra: `O((V + E) log V)` or `O(E log V)` with a binary heap.
*   `O(V^2)` with an array-based PQ.

**JavaScript Code Example:**

```javascript
// Using the same PriorityQueue class from Dijkstra's example

function prims(graph) {
    if (Object.keys(graph).length === 0) return { mstEdges: [], totalWeight: 0 };

    const parent = {};         // parent[v] is the vertex connecting v to MST
    const key = {};            // key[v] is the min weight of edge connecting v to MST
    const inMST = {};        // Tracks vertices in MST
    const mstEdges = [];
    let totalWeight = 0;

    const pq = new PriorityQueue();
    const vertices = Object.keys(graph);
    const startNode = vertices[0]; // Arbitrary start node

    for (const vertex of vertices) {
        key[vertex] = Infinity;
        parent[vertex] = null;
        inMST[vertex] = false;
    }

    key[startNode] = 0;
    pq.enqueue(startNode, 0);

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        const u = pq.dequeue();

        if (inMST[u]) continue; // Already processed
        inMST[u] = true;

        // Add edge to MST, except for the start node's initial "edge"
        if (parent[u] !== null) {
            mstEdges.push({ from: parent[u], to: u, weight: key[u] });
            totalWeight += key[u];
        }
        
        // If graph[u] is undefined (isolated node not part of this example type)
        if (!graph[u]) continue;

        for (const v_neighbor in graph[u]) {
            const weight = graph[u][v_neighbor];
            if (!inMST[v_neighbor] && weight < key[v_neighbor]) {
                key[v_neighbor] = weight;
                parent[v_neighbor] = u;
                pq.updatePriority(v_neighbor, key[v_neighbor]);
            }
        }
    }
    return { mstEdges, totalWeight };
}

// Example Graph (Undirected, so weights should be consistent)
const graph2 = {
    'A': { 'B': 2, 'D': 6 },
    'B': { 'A': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 8, 'E': 5 },
    'C': { 'B': 3, 'E': 7 },
    'D': { 'A': 6, 'B': 8, 'E': 9 },
    'E': { 'B': 5, 'C': 7, 'D': 9 }
};

console.log("\nPrim's Algorithm:");
const { mstEdges: pMstEdges, totalWeight: pTotalWeight } = prims(graph2);
console.log("MST Edges:", pMstEdges);
console.log("Total MST Weight:", pTotalWeight);
// Expected Total Weight: 2(A-B) + 3(B-C) + 5(B-E) + 6(A-D) -> A-D is not taken.

## 6. Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)

**Problem Statement:**
Same as Prim's: Find an MST for a connected, undirected, weighted graph.

**Greedy Choice:**
Sort all edges in the graph by their weights in non-decreasing order. Iterate through the sorted edges and add an edge to the MST if and only if it connects two previously disconnected components of vertices (i.e., it does not form a cycle with the edges already selected for the MST).

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty set `mstEdges` to store the edges of the MST.
    *   Create a list of all edges in the graph: `[{u, v, weight}, ...]`.
    *   Sort this list of edges by `weight` in ascending order.
    *   Initialize a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure (also known as Union-Find). Each vertex initially is in its own set (its own component).

2.  **Iteration:**
    For each edge `(u, v)` with weight `w` in the sorted list:
    a.  Check if `u` and `v` are already in the same connected component using the DSU's `find` operation (e.g., `find(u) !== find(v)`).
    b.  If they are in different components (i.e., adding this edge does not form a cycle):
        *   Add the edge `(u, v)` to `mstEdges`.
        *   Merge the components of `u` and `v` using the DSU's `union` operation.
    c.  Stop when `V-1` edges have been added to `mstEdges` (or all edges processed).

3.  **Result:** `mstEdges` contains the edges of an MST.

**Why it's Greedy:**
Kruskal's algorithm is greedy because it always considers the "cheapest" available edge next. If this edge doesn't create a cycle, it's added. The underlying principle is that if an edge is the lightest edge connecting two distinct components, it must be part of some MST.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   List of Edges: To store all graph edges.
*   Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find: To efficiently track connected components and detect cycles.

**Time Complexity:**
*   `O(E log E)` for sorting the edges.
*   DSU operations (with path compression and union by rank/size) are nearly constant on average, `O(α(V))` (inverse Ackermann function).
*   So, the dominant factor is sorting: `O(E log E)`. This can also be written as `O(E log V)` since `E` can be up to `V^2`.

**JavaScript Code Example:**

```javascript
class DSU { // Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
    constructor(vertices) {
        this.parent = {};
        this.rank = {}; // For union by rank optimization
        for (const vertex of vertices) {
            this.parent[vertex] = vertex;
            this.rank[vertex] = 0;
        }
    }

    // Find with path compression
    find(i) {
        if (this.parent[i] === i) {
            return i;
        }
        this.parent[i] = this.find(this.parent[i]); // Path compression
        return this.parent[i];
    }

    // Union by rank
    union(i, j) {
        const rootI = this.find(i);
        const rootJ = this.find(j);

        if (rootI !== rootJ) {
            if (this.rank[rootI] < this.rank[rootJ]) {
                this.parent[rootI] = rootJ;
            } else if (this.rank[rootI] > this.rank[rootJ]) {
                this.parent[rootJ] = rootI;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootJ] = rootI;
                this.rank[rootI]++;
            }
            return true; // Merged
        }
        return false; // Already in same set
    }
}

function kruskals(graphVertices, edges) {
    // edges: array of {u: 'A', v: 'B', weight: 5}
    
    // 1. Sort all edges by weight
    edges.sort((a, b) => a.weight - b.weight);

    const dsu = new DSU(graphVertices);
    const mstEdges = [];
    let totalWeight = 0;
    let edgesCount = 0;

    // 2. Iterate through sorted edges
    for (const edge of edges) {
        if (dsu.find(edge.u) !== dsu.find(edge.v)) {
            dsu.union(edge.u, edge.v);
            mstEdges.push(edge);
            totalWeight += edge.weight;
            edgesCount++;
            if (edgesCount === graphVertices.length - 1) {
                break; // MST is complete
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if MST is formed (all vertices connected)
    if (edgesCount < graphVertices.length - 1 && graphVertices.length > 0) {
        // This can happen if the graph is not connected
        console.warn("Graph might not be connected, or not enough edges to form MST for all vertices.");
    }

    return { mstEdges, totalWeight };
}

## 7. Optimal Merge Pattern Problem

**Problem Statement:**
Given `n` sorted files (or lists) of different lengths (sizes), we want to merge them into a single sorted file. We can only merge two files at a time. Each merge operation of two files of size `s1` and `s2` costs `s1 + s2` (representing the number of element comparisons or movements). Find a sequence of merge operations (a merge pattern) such that the total merge cost is minimized.

**Greedy Choice:**
At each step, merge the two smallest currently available files (or already merged sub-files).

**Algorithm Steps:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Treat the sizes of the initial files as individual costs.
    *   Use a min-priority queue to store these sizes. Add all initial file sizes to the PQ.
    *   Initialize `totalMergeCost = 0`.

2.  **Iteration:**
    While there is more than one item (file size) in the priority queue:
    a.  Extract the two smallest sizes, `size1` and `size2`, from the PQ. (Greedy choice)
    b.  The cost of this merge is `currentMergeCost = size1 + size2`.
    c.  Add `currentMergeCost` to `totalMergeCost`.
    d.  Insert the new merged file size, `currentMergeCost`, back into the priority queue.

3.  **Result:** The final `totalMergeCost` is the minimum cost to merge all files.

**Why it's Greedy:**
This problem is analogous to building a Huffman tree. By always merging the two smallest files, we ensure that smaller files (which contribute less to the sum `s1+s2` at each step) are involved in merge operations "earlier" or "lower down" in the implicit binary merge tree. Their elements are thus "moved" or "compared" multiple times up the tree. Larger files are merged later. This strategy postpones the inclusion of large numbers into sums as long as possible, minimizing the cumulative sum.

**Data Structures Commonly Used:**
*   Min-Priority Queue: To efficiently find and extract the two smallest file sizes.

**Time Complexity:**
*   If `n` is the number of files:
    *   Building the initial PQ: `O(n)` (heapify) or `O(n log n)` (inserting one by one).
    *   There will be `n-1` merge operations. Each involves two `extractMin` and one `insert` into the PQ. Each PQ operation takes `O(log k)` where `k` is the current size of PQ (max `n`).
    *   Total: `O(n log n)`.

**JavaScript Code Example:**

```javascript
// Can reuse the PriorityQueue from Dijkstra, or a simpler one since only numbers are stored.
// Let's make a simpler one for clarity here, tailored for numbers.
class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    insert(value) {
        this.heap.push(value);
        this._heapifyUp();
    }

    extractMin() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return null;
        if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();

        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this._heapifyDown();
        return min;
    }

    peek() {
        return this.isEmpty() ? null : this.heap[0];
    }

    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.heap.length === 0;
    }

    _heapifyUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[index] < this.heap[parentIndex]) {
                [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]] = [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]];
                index = parentIndex;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    _heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.heap.length;
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let smallest = index;

            if (leftChildIndex < length && this.heap[leftChildIndex] < this.heap[smallest]) {
                smallest = leftChildIndex;
            }
            if (rightChildIndex < length && this.heap[rightChildIndex] < this.heap[smallest]) {
                smallest = rightChildIndex;
            }

            if (smallest !== index) {
                [this.heap[index], this.heap[smallest]] = [this.heap[smallest], this.heap[index]];
                index = smallest;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}


function optimalMergePattern(fileSizes) {
    if (!fileSizes || fileSizes.length === 0) return 0;
    if (fileSizes.length === 1) return 0; // No merges needed

    const pq = new MinHeap();
    for (const size of fileSizes) {
        pq.insert(size);
    }

    let totalMergeCost = 0;

    while (pq.size() > 1) {
        const size1 = pq.extractMin();
        const size2 = pq.extractMin();

        const currentMergeCost = size1 + size2;
        totalMergeCost += currentMergeCost;
        pq.insert(currentMergeCost); // Add the new merged file size back
    }

    return totalMergeCost;
}

// Example Usage:
const files = [20, 30, 10, 5, 30];
console.log("\nOptimal Merge Pattern Problem:");
const mergeCost = optimalMergePattern(files);
console.log("File sizes:", files);
console.log("Minimum merge cost:", mergeCost);

// Step-by-step for files = [20, 30, 10, 5, 30]
// PQ: [5, 10, 20, 30, 30]
// 1. Extract 5, 10. Cost = 5 + 10 = 15. TotalCost = 15. PQ: [15, 20, 30, 30]
// 2. Extract 15, 20. Cost = 15 + 20 = 35. TotalCost = 15 + 35 = 50. PQ: [30, 30, 35]
// 3. Extract 30, 30. Cost = 30 + 30 = 60. TotalCost = 50 + 60 = 110. PQ: [35, 60]
// 4. Extract 35, 60. Cost = 35 + 60 = 95. TotalCost = 110 + 95 = 205. PQ: [95]
// Result: 205

const files2 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
// PQ: [2,3,4,5,6,7]
// 1. 2+3 = 5. TC=5. PQ: [4,5,5,6,7]

// 4. 7+9 = 16. TC=25+16=41. PQ: [11,16]
// 5. 11+16 = 27. TC=41+27=68. PQ: [27]
// Result: 68
console.log("\nFile sizes:", files2);
const mergeCost2 = optimalMergePattern(files2);
console.log("Minimum merge cost:", mergeCost2); // Expected: 68
```

These are four powerful applications of the greedy strategy. Notice how in each case, a simple, locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution. The key is often in how you define "best local choice" and ensuring the problem has the underlying properties (like optimal substructure and the greedy-choice property) that allow this to work.

Let me know if you have any questions about these or want to explore other aspects!

### How to Identify a Greedy Problem?
There's no foolproof way, but look for these signs:
1.  **Optimization Problem:** You need to find the best (min/max) solution.
2.  **Sequential Choices:** The problem can be solved by making a series of choices.
3.  **Local Optimum "Feels" Right:** Does making the choice that looks best *right now* seem like a good strategy?
4.  **Optimal Substructure:** Can you break the problem down such that an optimal solution to the whole thing relies on optimal solutions to smaller parts?
5.  **Greedy Choice Property (Hardest to verify without proof):** Can you argue that a locally optimal choice doesn't prevent you from reaching a global optimum?

Often, you might try a greedy approach, test it with examples, and then try to prove its correctness or find a counterexample where it fails.
