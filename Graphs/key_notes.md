## Key Concepts & Strategies for Solving Graph Problems Smartly

Beyond knowing the standard algorithms, here's how to approach graph problems more effectively in an interview setting:

1.  **Model the Problem as a Graph (If Not Obvious):**
    *   Many problems that don't explicitly say "graph" can be modeled as one. Ask yourself:
        *   What are the "entities" or "states"? These become **vertices**.
        *   What are the "connections," "transitions," or "relationships" between them? These become **edges**.
        *   Are the connections directional? (Directed vs. Undirected)
        *   Do connections have costs/distances? (Weighted vs. Unweighted)
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Word Ladder: Words are vertices, an edge exists if words differ by one letter.
        *   Course Schedule: Courses are vertices, prerequisites form directed edges.
        *   States in a game/puzzle: Each state is a vertex, moves between states are edges.
        *   Social network analysis, dependency resolution, network routing.

2.  **Choose the Right Traversal (BFS vs. DFS):**
    *   **BFS:**
        *   **Shortest path in an unweighted graph.**
        *   When you need to explore level by level or find something "closest" to the start.
        *   Generally good for finding *if* a path exists or the shortest path in terms of edges.
        *   Can be less memory efficient (queue can grow large) if the graph is wide.
    *   **DFS:**
        *   **Pathfinding (finding *any* path, not necessarily shortest).**
        *   **Cycle detection.**
        *   **Topological sort.**
        *   **Exploring all possibilities exhaustively (like backtracking on a graph structure).**
        *   Problems involving connectivity, like finding connected components or SCCs.
        *   Can be more memory efficient (stack depth) if the graph is deep but not wide.
    *   **If unsure, start by thinking which one aligns better with the problem's core question.**

3.  **Master the "Visited" Set:**
    *   **Crucial for avoiding infinite loops in cyclic graphs.**
    *   **Ensures each node is processed only once (for efficiency).**
    *   **Different states of "visited" for complex DFS scenarios:**
        *   `UNVISITED`: Not yet encountered.
        *   `VISITING` (or `IN_STACK`, `GREY`): Currently in the recursion stack for DFS (important for directed cycle detection).
        *   `VISITED` (or `PROCESSED`, `BLACK`): Finished processing this node and all its descendants.

4.  **Path Reconstruction:**
    *   If the problem asks for the actual path (not just its length or existence), you need to store predecessor/parent information during traversal.
    *   In BFS: `parent[neighbor] = current_node`.
    *   In DFS: `parent[neighbor] = current_node` just before the recursive call to `dfs(neighbor)`.
    *   After traversal, backtrack from the destination node to the source using the parent pointers.

5.  **Implicit vs. Explicit Graphs:**
    *   **Explicit:** The graph structure (nodes, edges) is given directly.
    *   **Implicit:** Nodes and edges are defined by rules or states. You generate neighbors on the fly. (e.g., Word Ladder, a game board where states are nodes and moves are edges). Traversal algorithms still apply.

6.  **Handling Disconnected Graphs:**
    *   If you need to process all nodes, your main traversal loop might need to iterate through all potential starting nodes and initiate a BFS/DFS if a node hasn't been visited yet. This is how you find connected components.

7.  **Think About Edge Cases and Constraints:**
    *   Empty graph, graph with one node, no edges.
    *   Disconnected components.
    *   Cycles (and if they matter for the problem).
    *   Self-loops, parallel edges (if the problem allows them and how your representation handles them).
    *   Directed vs. Undirected implications (e.g., an edge `u-v` in undirected means paths both ways).

8.  **Leverage Known Algorithm Properties:**
    *   Dijkstra needs non-negative weights.
    *   Bellman-Ford handles negative weights but is slower.
    *   Topological sort only applies to DAGs.
    *   MST algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's) are for connected, undirected, weighted graphs.

9.  **Consider the "Shape" and "Density" of the Graph:**
    *   **Sparse graph (`E` is close to `V`):** Adjacency list is usually best.
    *   **Dense graph (`E` is close to `V^2`):** Adjacency matrix might be acceptable, but adjacency list is still often preferred for consistency.
    *   Is it a tree? (Special properties: unique path between any two nodes, `E = V-1`).
    *   Is it a DAG? (No cycles, allows topological sort).

10. **Break Down Complex Problems:**
    *   Some graph problems are multi-step. For example, you might first need to detect cycles, then find a shortest path in a transformed version of the graph.
    *   "Can I simplify the problem first?" "Does solving a sub-problem help?"

11. **Using Extra Data Structures with Nodes/Edges:**
    *   Often, you'll need to store more than just connectivity.
        *   Distances from source (for shortest path).
        *   Parent pointers (for path reconstruction).
        *   Discovery/finish times (for DFS-based algorithms like Tarjan's SCC or topological sort).
        *   In-degrees (for Kahn's topological sort).

12. **When in Doubt, Draw it Out:**
    *   For small examples, visualizing the graph and stepping through your chosen traversal can reveal misunderstandings or flaws in your logic.

## More Common Graph Problems Asked in FAANG/Top Companies

Here's a list, categorized by common themes, including some that are more advanced or combine concepts:

### I. Traversal-Based & Connectivity

1.  **Number of Islands / Connected Components in a Grid:**
    *   **Problem:** Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
    *   **Approach:** Iterate through the grid. If you find a '1' that hasn't been visited, start a BFS or DFS from it to mark all connected land cells as visited. Increment island count.

2.  **Clone Graph:**
    *   **Problem:** Given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node contains a value and a list of its neighbors.
    *   **Approach:** Use BFS or DFS. Maintain a map from original nodes to their cloned nodes to handle cycles and avoid re-cloning. When visiting an original node, if it's not in the map, create its clone and add to map. Then, for each neighbor of the original node, recursively clone/retrieve its clone and add to the current cloned node's neighbors.

3.  **Rotting Oranges:**
    *   **Problem:** In a grid of `0` (empty), `1` (fresh orange), `2` (rotten orange), every minute, any fresh orange adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten. Return min minutes until no cell has a fresh orange. If impossible, return -1.
    *   **Approach:** Multi-source BFS. Start BFS from all initially rotten oranges simultaneously. Each "level" of BFS corresponds to one minute. Keep track of fresh orange count.

4.  **Word Ladder (I & II):**
    *   **Problem I:** Given `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList`, find length of shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, such that only one letter can be changed at a time, and each transformed word must exist in `wordList`.
    *   **Approach I:** Model as a graph where words are nodes and an edge exists if they differ by one letter. Perform BFS from `beginWord`.
    *   **Problem II:** Return all such shortest transformation sequences.
    *   **Approach II:** More complex. Usually involves BFS to find distances and then DFS/backtracking to reconstruct all paths of that shortest length.

5.  **Course Schedule (I & II):**
    *   **Problem I:** `numCourses` and `prerequisites` array `[[a, b]]` (course `b` is prereq for `a`). Can you finish all courses? (Cycle detection in a directed graph).
    *   **Approach I:** Use DFS (check for back-edges) or Kahn's algorithm (topological sort - if it produces `numCourses` nodes, then possible).
    *   **Problem II:** Return the ordering of courses you should take. (Topological sort).

6.  **Alien Dictionary:**
    *   **Problem:** List of words sorted lexicographically by the rules of an alien language. Derive the order of letters in this language.
    *   **Approach:** Build a directed graph where an edge `u -> v` means `u` comes before `v`. Extract these relationships by comparing adjacent words in the input list. Then, perform a topological sort on this graph.

### II. Shortest Path Variants

7.  **Network Delay Time:**
    *   **Problem:** `n` network nodes, `times` array `[[u, v, w]]` (time for signal from `u` to `v`). Given source `k`, find time it takes for all `n` nodes to receive signal. If impossible, return -1.
    *   **Approach:** Dijkstra's algorithm from source `k`. The answer is the maximum distance to any reachable node. If not all nodes are reachable, -1.

8.  **Cheapest Flights Within K Stops:**
    *   **Problem:** `n` cities, `flights` array `[[from, to, price]]`, `src`, `dst`, `k` (max stops). Find cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops.
    *   **Approach:** Modified Bellman-Ford or a variation of Dijkstra that also considers number of stops. DP state: `dp[i][j]` = min cost to reach city `j` using at most `i` stops.

9.  **Path with Minimum Effort:**
    *   **Problem:** Grid `heights[row][col]`. Find path from top-left to bottom-right such that the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the path is minimized.
    *   **Approach:** Can be solved with a modified Dijkstra where edge weights are the effort (abs difference) and you're minimizing the max edge weight on a path. Or binary search on the answer (max possible effort) and use BFS/DFS to check feasibility.

### III. MST and Graph Properties

10. **Connecting Cities with Minimum Cost / Min Cost to Connect All Points:**
    *   **Problem:** Given coordinates of points, cost to connect two points is Manhattan distance. Find min cost to make all points connected.
    *   **Approach:** This is an MST problem. Create edges between all pairs of points with weights as their distances. Run Prim's or Kruskal's.

11. **Find if Path Exists in Graph / Find the Town Judge:**
    *   **Problem (Town Judge):** In a town, there are `n` people. `trust[i] = [a, b]` means person `a` trusts person `b`. Town judge trusts nobody, and everybody (except judge) trusts the judge. Find the judge.
    *   **Approach:** Calculate in-degrees and out-degrees. Judge has `in-degree = n-1` and `out-degree = 0`.

12. **Redundant Connection (I & II):**
    *   **Problem I (Undirected):** Given edges of a graph that started as a tree with `N` nodes and `N-1` edges, one additional edge was added. Find the redundant edge.
    *   **Approach I:** Use Union-Find. Iterate through edges. If adding an edge connects two nodes already in the same set, that's the redundant one.
    *   **Problem II (Directed):** Similar, but graph is directed and the result is a rooted tree where each node has one parent (except root). The added edge can create a cycle or make a node have two parents. Harder.

### IV. More Advanced / Combined Concepts

13. **Critical Connections in a Network / Bridges:**
    *   **Problem:** Find all "critical" connections (edges) in a network (undirected graph) such that if removed, it increases the number of connected components.
    *   **Approach:** Tarjan's bridge-finding algorithm (DFS-based, uses discovery times and low-link values).

14. **Accounts Merge (Union-Find or DFS/BFS):**
    *   **Problem:** List of accounts, each `account[0]` is name, rest are emails. If two accounts share an email, they belong to same person. Merge accounts.
    *   **Approach:** Build a graph where emails are nodes, or use Union-Find where each email (or account index) is an element. Group connected emails/accounts.

15. **Optimize Water Distribution in a Village:**
    *   **Problem:** `n` houses. Can build wells (`wells[i]` cost) or lay pipes between houses (`pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost]`). Find min cost to supply water to all houses.
    *   **Approach:** Model as an MST problem. Create a "dummy" source node representing the water source. Edges from dummy node to house `i` have weight `wells[i]`. Add pipe edges as given. Run MST on this augmented graph.

**Smart Tip for Interviews:**
When faced with a graph problem:
1.  **Clarify:** Graph type (directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted), constraints, expected output.
2.  **Represent:** How will you store it? (Usually adjacency list).
3.  **Algorithm Sketch:** Which standard algorithm seems like a good starting point? (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
4.  **Adapt:** How do you need to modify the standard algorithm for this specific problem's constraints or goals? (e.g., what to store in `visited`, how to handle weights, what defines a "solution state").
5.  **Complexity:** Analyze time and space.

This comprehensive list and the strategies should equip you well. The key is to internalize the fundamental algorithms (BFS, DFS) and then understand how they serve as building blocks for more complex problems.
